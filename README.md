# EEG-Statistical-Modelling

Contains MATLAB program for EEG analysis, as well as example analysis outputs. Analysis includes EEG preprocessing, labeling, epoching, ICA, ERP analysis, and paired paired t-test. EEG signals are recorded in an awareness experiment involving auditory stimuli, and analysis is done to investigate the neural correlates of auditory awareness, specifically the differences in brain responses between aware and unaware perception of stimuli.
